## Berkeley Artificial Intelligence - Pacman Projects

* You can find information about the projects here: [The Pac-Man Projects](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp22/projects/)

* The code was written in the framework of Artificial Intelligence class in University (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens)


### Set Up

* Code written in Python (2)

* For each project you have to download all the files and follow the directions from the site above 

* To confirm that the code is running properly, execute the command python autograder.py (in a Linux terminal or in Windows Powershell or in Mac terminal)

### Projects Overview

* Project 0: Tutorial

* Project 1: Search (Depth First, Breadth First, Uniform Cost, and A* Search Algorithms, Suboptimal Search and designing cost functions)

* Project 2: Multiagent (Multiagent Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax Algorithms and designing evaluation functions)

#### Files to implement
